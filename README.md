# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Saw this video on the internet where a number of rocks, paper and scissors are randomly moving on a 2D plane and if there is a collision between a rock and a scissors, the rock turns to scissor and so on (the usual rules of rockpaperscissors that we all play). This is a simulation for the same made with pygame. 

Enter intial number of rocks, number of papers, number of scissors and watch thte battle unfold!
