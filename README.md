# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Saw this video on the internet where a number of rocks, paper and scissors are randomly moving on a 2D plane and if there is a collision between a rock and a paper, the rock turns to paper and so on (following the usual rules of rockpaperscissors that we all play). This is a simulation for the same made with pygame.

Enter intial number of rocks, number of papers, number of scissors and watch thte battle unfold!

P.S. I made some modifications in the rules to make the game more interesting.
